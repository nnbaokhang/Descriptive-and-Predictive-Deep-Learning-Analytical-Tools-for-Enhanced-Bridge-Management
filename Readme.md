# Data-Driven Bridge Management

This repository tracks the progress of the Descriptive and Predictive Deep Learning Bridge Management project.

## Below is a list of important Jupyter Notebook files in this repo and descriptions of what they contain:

1. **Data_Exploration_Integration.ipynb:** This notebook contains code that correlates matching bridge IDs from each year in order to form a time series of bridge evaluations over time.
2. **Data_Exploration_Integration_Weather_Stations.ipynb:** This notebook contains code that concatenates several bridge ID time series files into a single one. Further, it contains code (in progress) which correlates bridge IDs to nearest weather stations for each year.
3. **Dataset_Exploration.ipynb:** This notebook is work from the very initial stage of data exploration for this project. It examined an initial dataset obtained from CCD regarding bridge evaluations in almost identical format to NBI datasets. Visualizations via box plots, desnity plots, a pair plot, as well as a correlation matrix are included.
4. **map_2019_weatherstns_bridges.ipynb:** This notebook primarily includes code that handles the integration of coordinate types offered by both the NBI and NOAA datasets for the primary purpose of visualization/mapping of locations of bridge IDs and weather stations. 
5. **NBI_Comparative_Exploration.ipynb:** This notebook provides a brief examination of the quantity of non-null entries available for unique bridge IDs for the latest and most recent years of data provided by NBI. 
6. **NBI_Time_Series_Data_For_Clustering.ipynb:** This notebook specifically prepares our NBI data for an initial clustering test. It arranges each bridge ID as a time series for a period of 22 time steps, performing data holding for missing values.
7. **NBI_Weather_data_exploration.ipynb:** This notebook includes early exploration of NBI and NOAA data. Useful code is contained in this notebook for handling conversion of coordinate formats from NBI and NOAA data for proper integration. This notebook also records studies of the geospatial locations of bridges and weather stations.
8. **NOAA_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb:** This notebook is a very early exploration of the NOAA dataset. It aims to understand the structure of the dataset as well as what type of data is contained within it.
8. **lstm_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains the code for the lstm bridge forecasting. This link was used to set up the environment for gpu utilization: https://towardsdatascience.com/setting-up-tensorflow-on-windows-gpu-492d1120414c. The Anaconda environment name for reference was called tf_bridge_management and the Jupyter Notebook kernel name was tf_bridge_management_kernel.
9. **simple_dense_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for simple dense bridge forecasting. The individual time series are flattened into one dimensional arrays for training on a simple Dense architecture.
10. **bidirectional_lstm_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for bidirectional lstm bridge forecasting.
11. **cnn_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for cnn bridge forecasting. The individual time series are formed into matrices that the cnn accepts.
12. **gru_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for gru bridge forecasting. 
13. **weather_and_bridge_data_concatenation.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for concatenating the weather data to the NBI dataset for time series analysis. It also writes these time series as rows in a dataframe to a .csv file.
14. **tcn_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for tcn bridge forecasting. Utilizes this keras-tcn implementation: https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn
15. **cnn_with_bilstm_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for cnn + bidirectional lstm bridge forecasting.
16. **multi_channel_cnn_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for multi-channel cnn bridge forecasting.
17. **regressionbased_time_series_forecasting.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for regression-based bridge forecasting.

In addition to these notebooks, various excel and csv files are included that the notebooks utilize.

Because of the size of data generated by some of the notebooks, we have stored a majority of the time series data files in csv format in a Google Drive folder.
